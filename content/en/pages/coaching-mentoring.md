I help you lead from the heart and develop your own unique leadership style.

My goal is to help you unlock your full potential and equip you with the tools you need to excel.

Everyone is different, and coaching isn't one-size-fits-all. Monthly 1:1 sessions are where many clients see the most progress. In those sessions, we'll work together to build clarity, confidence, and a pace that feels sustainable.

Together, we often work on:

- Overcoming impostor syndrome and limiting beliefs.
- Clarifying goals and next steps.
- Building confidence in leadership and decision-making.
- Creating habits and systems that support growth.

## Who This Is For
Women in tech, quality engineers, and leaders who want to do their best work and grow with purpose.

Areas I love: leadership development, values exploration, goal setting, habits and systems, and quality engineering.
