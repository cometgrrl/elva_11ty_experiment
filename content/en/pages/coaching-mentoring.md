Through coaching, my goal is to help you uncover your hidden potential and equip you with the tools you need to excel.

As a leadership consultant & mentor, I aim to help clients lead from the heart and develop their own unique leadership style.

Together, we often work on:

- Overcoming impostor syndrome and limiting beliefs.
- Clarifying goals and next steps.
- Building confidence in leadership and decision-making.
- Creating habits and systems that support growth.

## Who I Work With
Women in tech, quality engineers, and leaders who want to do their best work and grow with purpose.

Areas I love: leadership development, values exploration, goal setting, habits and systems, and quality engineering.
