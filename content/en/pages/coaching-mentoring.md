As a woman in tech, I know what it's like to question yourself even when you're doing great work. It's part of why this work matters so much to me.

I help you lead from the heart, trust your voice, and grow into a leadership style that feels like you.

Coaching isn't one-size-fits-all. Monthly 1:1 sessions are where many clients see the most progress, and where we build clarity, confidence, and a plan to achieve your goals.

Together, we often work on:

- Overcoming impostor syndrome and limiting beliefs.
- Clarifying goals and next steps.
- Building confidence in leadership and decision-making.
- Creating habits and systems that support growth.

## Who This Is For
Women in tech, quality engineers, and leaders who want to do their best work and grow with purpose.

I love working with clients on leadership development, values exploration, goal setting, habits and systems, and quality engineering.
