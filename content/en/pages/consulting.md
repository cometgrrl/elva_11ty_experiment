Practical support to strengthen quality culture and deliver better software.

AI is speeding up development, but traditional quality processes can struggle to keep pace. I help teams apply AI to testing and automation so quality matches the new velocity. The result: AI-level velocity with a high bar for quality.

Here’s how I support teams:

- Assess quality gaps and define a clear AI-enabled testing strategy.
- Improve testing standards, tools, and processes.
- Coach teams so quality becomes a shared habit.

I work with teams and companies who want consistent, reliable delivery without slowing down.

With over 20 years in quality engineering, I’ve led teams, built quality programs, and helped organizations ship reliably at scale. I currently lead quality engineering and automation at Grindr.

Previously, I led global quality engineering efforts at Automattic and built a quality and engineering productivity organization from the ground up at Pinger. I’ve also partnered with teams and leaders at companies like Slack, EarnIn, and TestGorilla.
